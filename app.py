st.write('NannyML is an open-source python library that allows you to estimate post-deployment model performance (without access to targets), detect data drift, and intelligently link data drift alerts back to changes in model performance. Built for data scientists, NannyML has an easy-to-use interface, interactive visualizations, is completely model-agnostic and currently supports all tabular use cases, classification and regression.')
